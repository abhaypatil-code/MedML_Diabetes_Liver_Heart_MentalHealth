Liver Disease Prediction - Preprocessing Pipeline Summary

Dataset Information:
  Original shape: (583, 11)
  Final shape (unscaled): (570, 18)
  Total Features after engineering: 17
  Target variable: Selector (1=Liver Disease, 0=No Disease)

Preprocessing Steps Completed:
  1. Loaded Data with column names
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
  3. Target Variable Conversion to binary
  4. Missing Values Imputation (median for AGRatio)
  5. Categorical Encoding (Gender)
  6. Outlier Detection and Capping using IQR
  7. Feature Engineering (7 new features created)
  8. Duplicate Removal
  9. Train-Test Split (80-20 stratified)
  10. Feature Normalization on Train only, transform Test
Outputs Generated:
  - Unscaled processed data (data/processed/liver_processed_unscaled.csv)
  - Scaled train and test splits (data/splits/liver_train_scaled.csv, liver_test_scaled.csv)
  - Scaler and label encoder saved (scalers/)
  - Visualizations saved (results/liver/visualizations/)
Ready for Model Training!
