Diabetes Prediction - Preprocessing Pipeline Summary

Dataset Information:
  Original shape: (768, 9)
  Final shape (cleaned, unscaled): (768, 14)
  Total features after engineering: 13
  Target variable: Outcome

Preprocessing Steps Completed (Correct Order):
  1. Data Loading
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations saved)
  3. Zero Values Handling (medically impossible NaN)
  4. Missing Values Imputation (median strategy)
  5. Outlier Detection and Capping (IQR method)
  6. Feature Engineering (new features created)
  7. Duplicate Removal
  8. Train-Test Split (80-20, stratified)
  9. Feature Normalization (StandardScaler, fitted on TRAIN only)
Outputs Generated:
  - Processed unscaled dataset (data/processed/diabetes_processed.csv)
  - Fitted scaler from train data (scalers/diabetes_scaler.pkl)
  - SCALED Train split (data/splits/diabetes_train.csv)
  - SCALED Test split (data/splits/diabetes_test.csv)
  - Visualizations (results/diabetes/visualizations/, 9+ images)
Ready for Model Training!
