Heart Disease Prediction - Preprocessing Pipeline Summary

Dataset Information:
  Original shape: (10000, 21)
  Final shape: (10000, 22)
  Total Features after engineering: 21
  Target variable: HeartAttackHistory

Preprocessing Steps Completed (Barriers Prevent Data Leakage):
  1. Data Loading
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations saved)
  3. Unnecessary Column Removal (PatientID)
  4. Feature Engineering (medical features)
  5. Duplicate Removal
  6. Train-Test Split (80-20, stratified)
--- Data Leakage Prevention Done ---
  7. Missing Value Imputation (fit on train only)
  8. Categorical Encoding (fit on train only)
  9. Outlier Detection & Capping (fit on train only)
  10. Feature Normalization (StandardScaler, fit on train only)
Artifacts Saved:
  - Processed dataset (data/processed/heart_processed.csv)
  - Train split (data/splits/heart_train.csv)
  - Test split (data/splits/heart_test.csv)
  - Fitted scaler (scalers/heart_scaler.pkl)
  - Fitted encoders/imputers/outlier_bounds (scalers/)
